## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this Document Management System, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to the project maintainers with details about the vulnerability
3. Include as much information as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days with assessment and timeline
- **Resolution**: Security fixes will be prioritized and released as soon as possible

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm audit fix
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files to version control
   - Use strong, unique values for all secrets
   - Rotate JWT secrets regularly

3. **File Upload Security**
   - Only upload files from trusted sources
   - Be aware of file size limits
   - Scan uploaded files for malware when possible

4. **Authentication**
   - Use strong passwords
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Implement proper session management

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs using Joi schemas
   - Sanitize file names and paths
   - Use parameterized queries for database operations

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper JWT token validation
   - Use bcrypt for password hashing
   - Implement role-based access control

3. **File Handling**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Store files outside web root
   - Use proper file permissions

4. **Database Security**
   - Use prepared statements
   - Implement proper database user permissions
   - Regular database backups with encryption

5. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Validate Content-Type headers
   - Implement proper CORS policies

## Security Features

This application includes several security features:

### Built-in Security Middleware

- **Helmet.js**: Sets various HTTP headers for security
- **CORS**: Configurable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: Joi-based request validation

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Role-based access control
- Session management

### File Security

- File type validation
- Size restrictions
- Secure file storage
- Malicious file detection

### Database Security

- SQL injection prevention
- Prepared statements
- Input sanitization
- Access logging

## Known Security Considerations

1. **OCR Processing**: OCR operations on user-uploaded files should be sandboxed
2. **File Storage**: Uploaded files are stored locally; consider cloud storage with proper IAM
3. **Database**: SQLite is used for development; use PostgreSQL or MySQL for production
4. **Logging**: Ensure logs don't contain sensitive information

## Security Updates

Security updates will be published as:

1. **Patch releases** for non-breaking security fixes
2. **Minor releases** for security enhancements
3. **Major releases** for significant security overhauls

## Security Checklist for Deployment

- [ ] Change all default passwords and secrets
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Configure log aggregation and monitoring
- [ ] Set up intrusion detection
- [ ] Implement regular security audits
- [ ] Keep all dependencies updated
- [ ] Configure proper file permissions

## Dependencies Security

Regular security audits are performed on dependencies:

```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Fix automatically fixable vulnerabilities
npm audit fix

# Check for outdated packages
npm outdated
```

## Compliance

This application is designed with the following compliance considerations:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy features
- **HIPAA**: Secure document handling (when properly configured)
- **SOX**: Audit logging and document retention

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact the project maintainers.
